Course Goals and Objectives: The primary goal of this class is to further develop students’ understanding of the research process specifically related to research related to their professions. Included will be an understanding of program evaluation and the use of research findings for program improvement. Also included will be evidence based practice and utilizing research to improve practice. An additional goal is to have students critically analyze published research and/or be able to conduct independent research. The objectives of this class will be to provide opportunities to learn and apply the skills necessary for evaluating research, including analyzing published instruments, and conducting independent research, including needs assessments and program evaluation. Emphasis will be on the following components of the research process: research questions and hypotheses, research design including qualitative research, action research and program evaluation, operationalization of variables, and measurement issues. The impact of culture on research design and analysis will additionally be addressed.

By the end of the semester students will be able to: · Identify various paradigms for conducting research (NASP 2.1, CC: 8b) · Understand the process of developing a research project (NASP 2.9; CC: 8b, 8c, 8d) · Write research questions and hypotheses (CC: 8b) · Understand the ethical issues involved in working with human participants (CC: 8f) · Identify and describe various types of quantitative research designs (CC: 8b) · Identify and describe various types of qualitative research designs (CC: 8b) · Identify the components and models of program evaluations, including needs assessments (NASP 2.9; CC: 8d, B3) · Identify and describe validity issues inherent in different types of designs (CC: 8b, 8c, 8d) · Discuss the use of research findings for program change (CC: 8d, B3) · Discuss the issues involved in conducting real world research (CC: 8a, 8e) · Discuss the impact of culture on various aspects of the research process (CC: 8f, 7f, 2c) · Critically evaluate published research articles (NASP 2.1; CC: 8a, 8b, 8d, 8e) · Design a proposal for research project (NASP 2.11; CC: 8a, 8b, 8e) · Write an Introduction and Literature Review for a research project (thesis students only)
